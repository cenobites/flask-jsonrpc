# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the cenobit.es repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, cenobit.es employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because cenobit.es holds the copyright.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).
#
# Names should be added to this file alphabetically like so:
# Name <email address>
