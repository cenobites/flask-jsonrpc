Tutorial
========

This tutorial walks you through building a small but complete JSON-RPC service
using Flask-JSONRPC. It is intended for readers who are new to JSON-RPC or to
Flask-JSONRPC but already have a basic understanding of Python and Flask.

You will build an application that exposes a few simple RPC methods, handles
errors cleanly, validates parameters, and organizes its code using common Flask
patterns.

If you prefer to jump right into writing code, you might start with the
:doc:`../quickstart`. Otherwise, begin with Step 1 below.
